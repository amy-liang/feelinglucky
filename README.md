## What it does
UW Feeling Lucky takes in a course name input (e.g MATH, CHEM, PSYC) and uses UW's API to output a random course of that subject. Are you feeling lucky? This application could help you find your next favourite course!

## What we learned
We learned a lot about using APIs and parsing JSON in Javascript. As I worked mostly on the front end aspects of the site, I also learned quite a bit about CSS properties and customizing input fields.
